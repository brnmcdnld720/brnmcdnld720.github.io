            <p>My name is Brian McDonald, and I am a <strong>Software Developer</strong>. I have lived in Idaho, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and am now located in Utah.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been playing with technology since I was old enough to type std::cout << "Hello World!" << endl; My road to software development has been filled with changes and pivots. The first serious career move I made was to be a dentist or more specifically an Orthodontist. I graduated with a bachelors in Exercise Physiology with a minor in Biology and attended three years of dental school at Midwestern University - College of Dental Medicine Illinois. I became sick and had to retire that dream. That is when I found Revature. Having a large student loan debt that couldn't be resolved to allow me to return to school for a computer science degree and two children and a wife depending on my financial gains, I trained as a full stack Java developer. After my training I moved to St. Louis where I worked for <b>Wells Fargo</b> as a front-end software developer for two years. My illness made a come back which led me to lots of temporary jobs while I struggled to figure out what to do with my life. I thought that Software Development had been closed to me but I have re-doubled my efforts to improve my learning and understanding of programming to show my future employers that I am worth every penny.</p>
            <p>I love to work with a team and am a dedicated participant. Through my experiences I have gained an excellent ability to work well with others. I have worked as a manager before and through that have gained invaluable experiences that have helped me learn how to get the most out of my team and more importantly how to be the best team player I can be.</p>
            <p>My family is my main hobby! I love to spend time with my wife and kids. While I'm not spending time with family I enjoy creating and playing video games. One of my first forays into game development using vanila JS can be found <a href="https://happy-go-lucky.onrender.com">here</a> (right now it really is just movment and images). Although I do not have much time for my side projects I enjoy creating; whether in wood, music, or technology.</p>
